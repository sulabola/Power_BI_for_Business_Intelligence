### Introduction to Power BI

This document provides an overview of Microsoft Power BI, including its core features, installation steps, recommended settings, and the end-to-end workflow used in the course. It explains why Power BI is widely used, how it compares to Excel, and introduces the Power Query Editor, Data View, Model View, and Report View. The file also includes helpful resource links and setup instructions for beginning the Power BI learning project.

### Connecting and Shaping Data

This document demonstrates how to connect to various data sources and shape data using the Power Query Editor. The work in this `.pbix` file covers essential data preparation concepts, including Power BI’s front-end vs back-end structure, data connector types, and storage and connection modes. It also includes practical exercises on importing data from databases, Excel, and the web.

The transformations explored include table cleanup operations, text and numeric tools, date and time processing, change type with locale, calendar tables, index and conditional columns, grouping and aggregating, pivoting and unpivoting, and merging and appending queries. The file also applies Power Query’s QA and profiling tools, as well as parameter and data source settings. All steps were performed as part of learning how to build reliable and refreshable data pipelines in Power BI.

### Creating a Data Model

This document introduces the fundamentals of data modeling in Power BI. The `.pbix` file covers dimensional modeling concepts, including database normalization, fact and dimension tables, and the use of primary and foreign keys. It also demonstrates how to create, edit, and manage table relationships, including relationship cardinality, active and inactive relationships, and the differences between using relationships and merged tables.

Key modeling techniques include working with star and snowflake schemas, connecting multiple fact tables, and understanding filter context, filter flow, and bi-directional filters. Additional steps include organizing model layouts, setting data formats and categories, creating hierarchies, and hiding fields from the report view to maintain a clean and effective data model.
