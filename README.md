# Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence

This repository documents my learning journey through the Udemy course “*Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence*”, created by **Chris \& Aaron (Maven Analytics)**. All dashboards, exercises, and notes included here are my own work, created while following the course materials. I acknowledge and credit the original authors for their excellent instruction and course structure.

The purpose of this repository is to:
- Track my progress through the Power BI curriculum
- Build a portfolio of data models, DAX measures, and dashboards
- Demonstrate skills in data preparation, modeling, analysis, and visualization
- Share reproducible examples of my work for professional development

This repository includes:
- `.pbix` files for dashboards and exercises    
- Notes and summaries  
- Sample datasets

### Introduction to Power BI

This PDF document provides an overview of Microsoft Power BI, including its core features, installation steps, recommended settings, and the end-to-end workflow used in the course. It explains why Power BI is widely used, how it compares to Excel, and introduces the Power Query Editor, Data View, Model View, and Report View. The file also includes helpful resource links and setup instructions for beginning the Power BI learning project.

### Connecting and Shaping Data

This document demonstrates how to connect to various data sources and shape data using the Power Query Editor. The work in this `.pbix` file covers essential data preparation concepts, including Power BI’s front-end vs back-end structure, data connector types, and storage and connection modes. It also includes practical exercises on importing data from databases, Excel, and the web.

The transformations explored include table cleanup operations, text and numeric tools, date and time processing, change type with locale, calendar tables, index and conditional columns, grouping and aggregating, pivoting and unpivoting, and merging and appending queries. The file also applies Power Query’s QA and profiling tools, as well as parameter and data source settings. All steps were performed as part of learning how to build reliable and refreshable data pipelines in Power BI.

### Creating a Data Model

This document introduces the fundamentals of data modeling in Power BI. The `.pbix` file covers dimensional modeling concepts, including database normalization, fact and dimension tables, and the use of primary and foreign keys. It also demonstrates how to create, edit, and manage table relationships, including relationship cardinality, active and inactive relationships, and the differences between using relationships and merged tables.

Key modeling techniques include working with star and snowflake schemas, connecting multiple fact tables, and understanding filter context, filter flow, and bi-directional filters. Additional steps include organizing model layouts, setting data formats and categories, creating hierarchies, and hiding fields from the report view to maintain a clean and effective data model.

### Calculated Fields with DAX

This document introduces core concepts in Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) for building calculated fields in Power BI. The `.pbix` file covers the differences between DAX and the M language, creating calculated columns and measures, and understanding implicit vs explicit measures and quick measures.

Key topics include DAX syntax and operators, filter context, and essential function groups such as counting, logical and conditional functions, SWITCH, text, date and time, RELATED, CALCULATE, ALL, FILTER, and iterator functions. The file also explores time intelligence calculations and demonstrates how these functions support flexible and dynamic analysis within a data model.

### Visualizing Data with Reports

This document focuses on building interactive and well-designed Power BI reports. The `.pbix` file covers core visualization techniques, including dashboard design, adding and organizing report pages and objects, and working with cards, multi-row cards, line charts, bar charts, donut charts, KPI visuals, tables, and matrices. It also includes filtering options such as slicers, Top N filters, drill up/down, drillthrough, and map visuals.

Additional topics include bookmarks, custom navigation buttons, slicer panels, range and field parameters, custom visuals, and managing or viewing roles. The file concludes with steps for publishing reports to the Power BI Service.

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)

This document explores Power BI’s AI-driven visual tools. The `.pbix` file covers anomaly detection, smart narratives for automated insights, Q&A visuals for natural language queries, decomposition trees for root-cause exploration, and key influencers for identifying factors that impact business outcomes.

### Power BI Optimization Tools

This section introduces techniques for improving report performance and efficiency in Power BI. It covers the optimization ribbon, pausing visuals, optimization presets, applying all slicers, using the performance analyzer, and working with external tools to streamline development and troubleshooting.

---

### New Power BI Features and Updates

This section showcases several of the latest features introduced in Power BI. The .pbix files (New Power BI Features and Updates 1 \& New Power BI Features and Updates 2) demonstrate calculation groups, the new card visual, the DAX Query View, button slicers, list slicers, and visual calculations. They also explore INFO.VIEW functions and AI documentation using TMDL, highlighting how recent updates enhance modeling efficiency, interactivity, and overall report development.
